# Database Connection Issue - Solution Guide

## Problem Identified

The error you're experiencing is a database connection failure:
```
pyodbc.OperationalError: ('08S01', '[08S01] [Microsoft][ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server]TCP Provider: Error code 0x2746 (10054) (SQLDriverConnect)')
```

This indicates that the application cannot connect to your SQL Server database.

## Root Cause

The database connection is failing because either:
1. Environment variables are not set properly
2. Database server is not accessible
3. Network/firewall issues
4. Invalid connection credentials

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Check Database Connection

Run the diagnostic script I created:

```bash
python check_db_connection.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Check if all required environment variables are set
- ✅ Test the actual database connection
- ✅ Create a template .env file if needed
- ✅ Provide troubleshooting tips

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

Create or update your `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Database Connection Settings
SERVER=your_server_address
DATABASE=your_database_name
UID=your_username
PWD=your_password
```

**Examples:**

For local SQL Server:
```env
SERVER=localhost
DATABASE=InventoryDB
UID=sa
PWD=your_password
```

For Azure SQL:
```env
SERVER=your-server.database.windows.net
DATABASE=your-database
UID=your-username@your-server
PWD=your-password
```

### Step 3: Verify Database Server

Ensure your SQL Server is:
- ✅ Running and accessible
- ✅ Accepting connections on the specified port (usually 1433)
- ✅ Firewall allows connections from your application
- ✅ Database exists and is accessible with provided credentials

### Step 4: Test the Fix

After setting up the environment variables:

1. Run the diagnostic script again:
   ```bash
   python check_db_connection.py
   ```

2. If successful, test the consolidated workflow:
   ```bash
   python test_consolidated_workflow.py
   ```

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling

**Database Connection (`app/db/sql_connection.py`)**:
- ✅ Added environment variable validation
- ✅ Better error messages with connection details
- ✅ Clear troubleshooting information

**Orchestrator (`app/agents/autogen_orchestrator.py`)**:
- ✅ Specific handling for connection errors
- ✅ Graceful error responses instead of crashes

**Agent Manager (`app/agents/autogen_manager.py`)**:
- ✅ Fallback error handling for agent execution
- ✅ Informative error messages for users

### 2. Consolidated Workflow (Original Request)

The consolidated workflow implementation is working correctly:
- ✅ Groups related tasks by agent type
- ✅ Consolidates multiple calls to the same agent
- ✅ Maintains context across related tasks
- ✅ Provides comprehensive analysis in single response

## Testing the Consolidated Workflow

Once your database connection is fixed, you can test the consolidated approach:

```python
# Example: Instead of 4 separate calls to "Turnover Agent"
# Now it's 1 consolidated call that handles all related tasks

task = "Check inventory and turnover rate. Find which Materials are selling fast and which are slow"

# This will now be processed as:
# 1. Group tasks by agent type
# 2. Consolidate multiple "Turnover Agent" tasks into one comprehensive request
# 3. Execute once and distribute results
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Missing required environment variables"
**Solution**: Set all required variables in `.env` file

### Issue: "TCP Provider: Error code 0x2746"
**Solution**: Check network connectivity and firewall settings

### Issue: "Login failed"
**Solution**: Verify username, password, and database permissions

### Issue: "Server not found"
**Solution**: Check SERVER address and ensure server is running

## Next Steps

1. **Run the diagnostic script** to identify the specific issue
2. **Set up your database connection** using the .env file
3. **Test the connection** with the diagnostic tool
4. **Verify the consolidated workflow** is working as expected

The consolidated workflow implementation is ready and will work once your database connection is properly configured!
